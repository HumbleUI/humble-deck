# What is Humble UI?

Electron, but.

- JavaScript -> Clojure
- V8 -> JVM
- CSS/DOM -> Custom

# Part I: Why now?

People want apps

No such thing as native GUI

Native is expensive

No good alternatives

Prior art: Java UIs (AWT, Swing, JavaFX)

- Heart in the right place
- GUIs are possible in Java
- Although somewhat cursed

Prior art: QT

- Wrong language, mate
- Complicated

Prior art: Electron

- Two threads, JS, CSS, DOM, performance, bundle size üëé
- Hugely successful üëç

Prior art: Flutter

- Can emulate native feel
- Can build entire UI stack from scratch

How is Humble UI different?

- High-fidelity interactions
- Performance-oriented
- Platform-aware
- Easy to pick up
